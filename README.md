# ☕ Java Learning Journey

This repository is where I’m uploading all my Java practice projects as I learn the language for the first time.
Each folder contains small programs or exercises focused on understanding Java basics, OOP concepts and problem-solving.
It’s mainly a personal space to track my progress and growth as I explore Java step by step.
